# Restaurant reviews

This project was created for Udacity advanced front-end course. Responsive and accessible restaurants reviews site using serviceWorker to store the cache of all site assets so that all pages accessed by a user can be accessed when the user is not connected to a network.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Phyton 2.x

### Installing

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: ```python -V```. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000``` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use ```python3 -m http.server 8000```. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
* Note - For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as python by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter ```python -m http.server 8000```.

Clone the project and enter into the project folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/carollaginestra/restaurants-pwa.git
$ cd restaurants-pwa
```

And init a local client server using Python on your terminal:

Python 2: ``` $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 ```
or
Python 3: ``` $ python3 -m http.server 8000```

Access the site in your browser at:
``` 
http://localhost:8000
```
